# Resources

I also will compile a list of resources that I used to complete this project. I have

- never setup a home server
- never done any form of frontend web development
- never done any frontend design

so I think it would also be helpful to know what I used to actually learn how to do all of this.

## Home Server
I don't want to pay for an AWS machine for my senior project that will probably be used by a total of 5 people. So, I want to take some old laptops that the lovely Besser Company gave me to create my own home server. <br>
Below are the specs for both laptops (they're the same model)

Processor: __Intel i5-2520M 2.50GHz__ <br>
RAM: __4GB__

so uhhhhh, yeah they're pretty ass. Which means you shouldn't have any issue finding cheap equivalents.

## The very beginning

**ChatGPT** is the first resource I use for pretty much anything. Before any project I braindump every single thing I'm considering into an LLM. I don't have it write an code, I don't have it solve any issues, I just want to know what I need for my specific application.

From there, I watched these youtube videos:
1. Why not to host your own server: https://youtu.be/URWlY3Qr9l8?si=AHPFoeVhQ5BfgTHE
2. What to look for when hosting your own server: https://youtu.be/5FVsJYsuBCQ?si=ROFsY6Y-MEjCb7tF
3. How to setup Ubuntu server: https://youtu.be/K2m52F0S2w8?si=aYFQNAzgSUQVIA_5
4. This article to create the ISO on a usb driver: https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#1-overview
5. This repo on security of home servers: https://github.com/imthenachoman/How-To-Secure-A-Linux-Server
6. Made the ip static: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/setting-a-static-ip-in-ubuntu-linux-ip-address-tutorial/

## Frontend

Again, **ChatGPT** is the first source of information. I just explained exactly what I wanted out of my application, and asked what a complete beginner would have to do to accomplish this goal.

From there, I read through these:
1. HTML semantic elements: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp
2. CSS basics: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Your_first_website/Styling_the_content
3. CSS selectors: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Basic_selectors
4. 


## Backend

Yet again I start with **ChatGPT**â€”you know the drill.

1. Figuring out GitHub's API usage: https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/authenticating-with-a-github-app-on-behalf-of-a-user
